Basic Report Usage
=================
The script comes with some basic reporting Classes and methods which you can use to generate a report in CSV format.
currently only CSV file output is supported. other format such as JSON might be available in future.


USER API
---------
* Generate a report of all active users in your instance

.. code-block:: python

    from jiraone import LOGIN, USER

    user = "email"
    password = "token"
    link = "https://yourinstance.atlassian.net"
    LOGIN(user=user, password=password, url=link)


    if __name__ == '__main__':
        # the output of the file would be absolute to the directory where this python
        # file is being executed from
        USER.get_all_users(pull="active", user_type="atlassian", file="user_file.csv")



* Generate a report of all user in the instance and which group do they belong to

.. code-block:: python

    from jiraone import LOGIN, USER

    user = "email"
    password = "token"
    link = "https://yourinstance.atlassian.net"
    LOGIN(user=user, password=password, url=link)


    if __name__ == '__main__':
        # the output of the file would be absolute to the directory
        # where this python file is being executed from
        USER.get_all_users_group(pull="active", user_type="atlassian")


* Search and find users within your cloud instance.

.. code-block:: python

    from jiraone import LOGIN, USER

    user = "email"
    password = "token"
    link = "https://yourinstance.atlassian.net"
    LOGIN(user=user, password=password, url=link)


    if __name__ == '__main__':
        # the output of the file would be absolute to the directory
        # where this python file is being executed from
        name = "Prince Nyeche"  # displayName of a user
        # find multiple users, use a list
        # name = ["Prince Nyeche, "Prince"]
        USER.search_user(pull="active", user_type="atlassian", find_user=name)


* Get a mention of a cloud user.

.. code-block:: python

    from jiraone import LOGIN, USER

    user = "email"
    password = "token"
    link = "https://yourinstance.atlassian.net"
    LOGIN(user=user, password=password, url=link)


    if __name__ == '__main__':
        # the output of the file would be absolute to the directory
        # where this python file is being executed from
        # displayName of a user, to output multiple users separate by a comman
        # name = "Prince Nyeche,Prince,John Doe"
        name = "Prince Nyeche"
        USER.mention_user(name)



PROJECT API
-------------

* Generate a report of users in your instance, who has BROWSE access to the projects on the instance.


.. code-block:: python

    from jiraone import LOGIN, PROJECT

    user = "email"
    password = "token"
    link = "https://yourinstance.atlassian.net"
    LOGIN(user=user, password=password, url=link)


    if __name__ == '__main__':
        # the output of the file would be absolute to the directory
        # where this python file is being executed from
        PROJECT.projects_accessible_by_users("expand=insight,description", "searchBy=key,name", permission="BROWSE",
                                        pull="active", user_type="atlassian")


* Generate a report of the number of Dashboard on the Instance, who's the owner and who it is shared with.

.. code-block:: python

    from jiraone import LOGIN, PROJECT

    user = "email"
    password = "token"
    link = "https://yourinstance.atlassian.net"
    LOGIN(user=user, password=password, url=link)


    if __name__ == '__main__':
        # the output of the file would be absolute to the
        # directory where this python file is being executed from
        PROJECT.dashboards_shared_with()



* Generate a report, get all project list and users within a project as well as their corresponding project role in the project.

.. code-block:: python

    from jiraone import LOGIN, PROJECT

    user = "email"
    password = "token"
    link = "https://yourinstance.atlassian.net"
    LOGIN(user=user, password=password, url=link)


    if __name__ == '__main__':
        # the output of the file would be absolute to the
        # directory where this python file is being executed from
        PROJECT.get_all_roles_for_projects(pull="active", user_type="atlassian")


* Generate a report, get all attachments per issue on a project or search for projects and get all attachment urls

.. code-block:: python

    from jiraone import LOGIN, PROJECT

    user = "email"
    password = "token"
    link = "https://yourinstance.atlassian.net"
    LOGIN(user=user, password=password, url=link)


    if __name__ == '__main__':
        # the output of the file would be absolute to the
        # directory where this python file is being executed from
        # you can use any valid jql query
        jql = "project%20in%20(COM%2C%20PYT)%20order%20by%20created%20DESC"
        PROJECT.get_attachments_on_projects(query=jql)


* Transfer a file across instances or download a file to your local drive from an Instance

.. code-block:: python

 from jiraone import LOGIN, PROJECT
 from threading import Thread


 user = "email"
 password = "token"
 link = "https://yourinstance.atlassian.net"
 LOGIN(user=user, password=password, url=link)


 if __name__ == '__main__':
     # the output of the file would be absolute to the directory where this python file is being executed from
     jql = "project%20in%20(COM%2C%20PYT)%20order%20by%20created%20DESC"
     # the below method, helps you download a report of a list of files per issue on a project or on projects
     Thread(target=PROJECT.get_attachments_on_projects(query=jql)).start()
     # afterwards, you can use the below method to move attachments across instances without downloading it
     PROJECT.move_attachments_across_instances()
     # if you're using your own file structure say a csv file, you need to identify the index of the attachment
     # for this, 3 keyword args are used which are key=0, attach=1,  and file=2 -> all requires an integer value.
     # PROJECT.move_attachments_across_instances(attach_file="new.csv", key=0, attach=1, file=2)
     # To download an attachment locally use
     PROJECT.download_attachments(download_path="Download", attach=1, file=2)


* Track the number of comments sent to a reporter on per issue and get the total sum sent by the reporter and by other users.

.. code-block:: python

 from jiraone import LOGIN, PROJECT


 user = "email"
 password = "token"
 link = "https://yourinstance.atlassian.net"
 LOGIN(user=user, password=password, url=link)


 if __name__ == '__main__':
     # the output of the file would be absolute to the directory where this python file is being executed from
     # this method uses various keyword arguments:
     # pull -> string - available options [active, inactive, both]
     # user_type -> string - available options [atlassian, customer, app, unknown]
     # find_user -> string - display name of the user you're searching for
     # duration -> string - jql function to denote days of calendar e.g. startOfWeek(-1) or startOfMonth(-1)
     # status -> string - statuses you want to check e.g Open or Closed or Open, Closed for multiple statuses check
     # file -> string - a file name to use as place_holder for user search. if not it defaults to user_file.csv
     PROJECT.get_total_comments_on_issues(find_user="Prince Nyeche", pull="active", user_type="atlassian")


* Generate a report of all the issue history within a project or projects

Use ``LOGIN.api = False`` if you want to extract the issue history from a Server instance.

.. code-block:: python

 from jiraone import LOGIN, PROJECT

 user = "email"
 password = "token"
 link = "https://yourinstance.atlassian.net"
 # use {LOGIN.api = False} if you want to extract the issue history from a Server instance
 LOGIN(user=user, password=password, url=link)

 if __name__ == '__main__':
     # the output of the file would be absolute to the directory where this python file is being executed from
     jql = "project in (PYT) ORDER BY Rank DESC"  # A valid JQL query
     PROJECT.change_log(jql=jql)



Module API
-----------
The API from the :ref:`module-api` uses functions

* Generate a report of time in status of Jira issue.


.. code-block:: python

 from jiraone import LOGIN, PROJECT, file_reader
 from jiraone.module import time_in_status
 import json

 config = json.load(open('config.json'))
 LOGIN(**config)

 key = ["COM-12", "COM-14"]

 if __name__ == "__main__":
      time_in_status(PROJECT, key, file_reader, pprint=True, is_printable=False,
      output_format="json", report_folder="STATUSPAGE", report_file="time.csv",
      status="In progress", login=LOGIN, output_filename="result")

 # output
 # result.json file


This function has the ability to generate the time an issue has stayed in a particular status or it can generate all the time it stays in each and every status that exists within a Jira issue. I’ll explain what each argument within the function does, so you can get a clear picture of how to use it. The standard way to call this function is the way it is shown above. First, the PROJECT alias is used as a required positional argument and within the function calls the ``change_log()`` method. The second argument requires an issue key. Now you can be able to pass the issue key in various formats such as below

.. code-block:: python

 # previous statement

 key = "COM-12" # as a string
 key = "COM-12,COM-14" # a string separated by comma
 key = 10034 # an integer denoting the issueid
 key = ["COM-12", "COM-114", "TPS-14", 10024] # a list of issue keys or issue ids
 key = {"jql": "project = COM ORDER BY created DESC"} # a dict using JQL

The third argument is file_reader function which you will need to pass or you can pass as a keyword argument as ``reader=file_reader``. The remaining arguments can be passed as keyword arguments, ``pprint`` enables you to print out the time in status in Jira’s pretty format e.g. 13d 11h 22m 15s if it is set to True otherwise if it is not set at all, you will get the DateTime output as *13 days, 11:22:15.913* which is a time delta string of the DateTime string collected from the issue history. The output_format argument enables you to generate a report file either in *CSV* or *JSON* format. The words have to be strings and are case insensitive. E.g cSV or JsoN will output the correct file. The output_file argument basically just allows you to name the file, avoid using any extension as this will be automatically added based on the output_format. The status argument allows you to only output statuses that have that status name. For example, you want a report of only “In Progress” status, then you should write the name "In Progress" (this is case sensitive) as the value to the status argument. If left blank, the result will be all the statuses within the issues being searched. Therefore, if you want the time in status for all the statuses that exist within the Jira issues, do not set the status argument. The login argument is essential to the function as it is required for authenticating your API to the Jira issues. The `report_file` basically helps within the history generation, you do not have to set this as it is optional. The same goes for ``report_folder`` you do not have to set this as it is optional.

Once you run the script, you will end up with a report that looks like the one below as the output

.. code-block:: json

 [
  {
   "author": "Prince Nyeche",
   "issueKey": "COM-12",
   "status": "To Do",
   "summary": "Workflow test 3",
   "timeStatus": "0h 00m 19s"
  },
  {
   "author": "Prince Nyeche",
   "issueKey": "COM-14",
   "status": "In Progress",
   "summary": "Workflow test 3",
   "timeStatus": "8d 6h 32m 52s"
  }
 ]


.. note::

  The ``time_in_status`` - ``pprint`` argument supports both string and bool data types as of v0.7.9. When set with the string "timestamp" it produces the time_in_status with a
  timestamp.


* Update custom field or system fields using a field update function. Please ensure that the fields you want to update is visible on screen in your projects, if not you will get a 400 error response instead. The API doesn't override the screen functions.


.. code-block:: python

 from jiraone import LOGIN, USER, echo, field
 from jiraone.module import field_update
 import json

 # a configuration file which is a dict containing keys user, password and url
 config = json.load(open('config.json'))
 LOGIN(**config)

 key = 'ITSM-4'
 name = 'Last Update User'  # A single user picker field

 if __name__ == "__main__":
      change = USER.search_user('Prince Nyeche')[0].get('accountId')
      make = field_update(field, key, name, data=change)
      echo(make)

 # output
 # <Response [204]>


The above function is able to update any field used on Jira cloud. All you simply need to do is find the field based on it's name (case sensitive). If it exist, then a result will be shown for it. The field_update requires the below argument.
* field: a call to the :ref:`field-class` class needs to be passed as the first argument.
* key_or_id: An issue key or issue id needs to be passed as the second argument or you can use a keyword argument.
* update: A way to update the custom field. It accepts two valid values either ``add`` (adds a value to a list or dict) or `remove` (removes from a value to a list or dict)
* name: The name of a field
* data: The data item we want to change which could be any data types.

Another example is given below to update multiple value set to a field. Use the ``update`` argument to add or remove values. Most of the fields that requires add or removing can be places in a list such as components, labels, fixversions, multicheckboxes, multiselect etc - these fields items can be places in a list as shown below to either add or remove items from it.

.. code-block:: python

 from jiraone import LOGIN, echo, field
 from jiraone.module import field_update
 import json

 # a configuration file which is a dict containing keys user, password and url
 config = json.load(open('config.json'))
 LOGIN(**config)

 key = 'ITSM-4'
 name = 'Component Field'  # A Component field

 if __name__ == "__main__":
      vals = ['Browser', 'Firefox']
      make = field_update(field, key, name, data=vals, update="add")
      echo(make)

 # output
 # <Response [204]>


.. code-block:: python

 #...previous statement

 key = 'ITSM-4'
 name = 'Story Points'  # A Story point field

 if __name__ == "__main__":
      vals = 3 # An integer and not string for Story Points type field
      make = field_update(field, key, name, data=vals)
      echo(make)

 # output
 # <Response [204]>


.. code-block:: python

 #...previous statement

 key = 'ITSM-4'
 name = 'Helper Date'  # A Date picker field

 if __name__ == "__main__":
      vals = '2021-10-24'
      make = field_update(field, key, name, data=vals)
      echo(make)

 # output
 # <Response [204]>


.. code-block:: python

 #...previous statement

 key = 'ITSM-4'
 name = 'Due date picker'  # A Date time picker field

 if __name__ == "__main__":
      vals = '2021-10-11T19:56:28.118+0200'
      make = field_update(field, key, name, data=vals)
      echo(make)

 # output
 # <Response [204]>

* Bulk change email addresses of organization users

This function helps with changing the email addresses in bulk of organization users. The target email address must not exist as an Atlassian account for the change to be effective. All domains needing the bulk change needs to be verified within your organization for the changes to work.


For example

.. code-block:: python

 from jiraone.module import bulk_change_email

 token = "Vhsj28UJsXXX"
 file = "user.csv"
 bulk_change_email(file, token)

 # A CSV file needs to be added to the same directory the script is running from
 # The format of the CSV file has to be in the below format of max 4 columns
 # id,current_email, name, target_email
 # processes the information.


* Bulk change email address of organization users with an existing Atlassian account.

This function helps to bulk change email address but only on the condition that the target email address already exist as an Atlassian account. To use this function, you must verify all the domains you wish to swap.


For example

.. code-block:: python

 from jiraone.module import bulk_change_swap_email

 token = "Vhsj28UJsXXX"
 file = "user.csv"
 user_list = "userlist.csv" # file containing all the users in your organization.
 bulk_change_swap_email(file, token, users=user_list)

 # A CSV file needs to be added to the same directory the script is running from
 # The format of the CSV file named "file" has to be in the below format of max 4 columns
 # id,current_email, name, target_email
 # processes the information.


For example

.. code-block:: python

 from jiraone.module import bulk_change_swap_email

 token = "Vhsj28UJsXXX"
 file = "user.csv"
 place_holder = "dummy@example.com" # You can supply a dummy email address which is non-existent
 # The above function of a dummy email is used as a placeholder to perform the swap.
 bulk_change_swap_email(file, token, dummy=place_holder)

 # A CSV file needs to be added to the same directory the script is running from
 # The format of the CSV file named "file" has to be in the below format of max 4 columns
 # id,current_email, name, target_email
 # processes the information.
